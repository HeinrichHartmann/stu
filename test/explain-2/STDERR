main.stu:5:1: file without command 'B' does not exist, although all its dependencies are up to date
main.stu:3:4: 'B' is needed by 'A'
*** Explanation: If a file rule has no command, this means that the file
is always up-to-date whenever its dependencies are up to date.  In general,
this means that the file is generated in conjunction with its dependencies.
