Stu is a Make-like build tool for POSIX eonvironments.  It was written
for the following two features:   

* Parametrized rules:  Like Make's '%' character, but there can be
  multiple parameters, and they have names.  The syntax is '$NAME',
  where NAME can be any name. 
* Dynamic dependencies:  The dependencies of a target can be generated
  dynamically.  When a dependency is enclosed in square brackets, it means
  that that file is built and dependencies are read from within that
  file. 

Other advantages over Make are:

* Error messages are much better (Make has the dreaded "missing
  separator") 
* Stu code is easier to read, as compared to Make:
** No templates for which the parameters are defined after its
   definition 
** Rule parameters have descriptive names, instead of %/$1/$2 as in Make
   (or %1/%2 as in Cook) 
** Stu has a proper tokenization pass, instead of Make's variable
   substitution syntax.  
* Variables are not used; instead Stu encourages to put everything in
  files. This makes builds much faster: In a typical Makefile, a lot of
  program logic must be implemented used Make functions (because of a
  lack of dynamic dependencies), making a large piece of code being
  executed on each Make invocation, even if the variables have not
  changed. 
* Stu catches typical Makefile errors such as dependencies that where
  not built.
* Stu has better support for interrupting large builds (Make will often
  hang or leave processes running) 
* Stu avoids the "inner platform" antipattern present in Make, in which
  a lot of shell functionality is duplicated in Make functions.  Stu
  encourages all program logic to be implemented in rules, i.e. using a
  proper shell.  

Stu is written in C++11 for POSIX platforms.  You should have no problem
compiling it on vanilla Linux and other POSIX-compliant platforms.  See
the file INSTALL for installation instructions.  The Makefile contains
specific compilation commands for G++; they have to be changed to use
another compiler. 

For a detailed description of Stu, see its man page.  Execute "make
stu.1" to compile the man page, and then use "man -l stu.1" to read it,
or follow the instructions in INSTALL to install the man page so you can
use "man stu" to read it. 

Stu was written to accommodate the Koblenz Network Collection project
(KONECT - konect.uni-koblenz.de) at the University of Koblenz-Landau.
It is thus mainly used for large data mining projects, where it manages
everything from acquiring data from the web, to performing experiments,
to generating plots and compiling the resulting Latex papers.  It is
also used for compiling C/C++ code, and for generating tarballs.  

Stu was written in 2014/2015 by Jerome Kunegis at the University of
Koblenz-Landau.
