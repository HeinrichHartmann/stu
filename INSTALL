There is no installation command or Make target.  To install Stu, do
the following:  

* Compile stu using 'make'.  This will build the executables
  'stu.ndebug' and 'stu.debug', the man page 'stu.1', and also run all
  unit tests.     

* Copy the executable 'stu.ndebug' (or 'stu.debug' for the debug
  version) to a bin/ directory under the name 'stu'.  You can of course
  also just execute it right from where it is.  The executable has no
  runtime dependencies, so it does not matter where it is residing
  while it is being executed, and also its filename does not matter.  

* Copy the man page 'stu.1' to a man page directory,
  e.g. /usr/share/man/man1/ or ~/man/man1/.  (In that second example,
  you will have to put $HOME/man into your $MANPATH additionally.)

REQUIREMENTS

* The Makefile assumes g++, and you need a version of it that
  has the -std=c++11 option.  If you don't, you have to edit the
  Makefile. 
* The unit tests assume that the filesystem supports UTF-8 filenames.
  Stu will work without such a filesystem, but you can't run the unit
  tests unless you remove the one offending test.
